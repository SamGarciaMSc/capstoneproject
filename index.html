Welcome to my Song Classification Capstone Project site!

My project is to build a genre and classification model ultimately to aid in attributing monetary value to song features.

Background

During the past 5 years, we have seen for the first time, the commoditisation of music as an asset class. Several music investment funds have materialised, even listed on the stock exchange for public trading, exploiting and trading music copyright (as well as, sometimes, the underlying master), in the same way any physical commodity such as gold or oil.

Note that we are primarily focused here on the copyright (which generates music royalties), within the world of muic publishing, as opposed to the Master which is within the realm of the Record Label. More info on that here: https://www.roundhillmusicroyaltyfund.com/resources/music-royalties-explained

#### The two major players in the space are Roundhill Fund Ltd and Hipgnosis Songs Fund Ltd:

Value by genre and vintage is one of the KPIs measured by these investment funds to help shareholders understand the Fund's portfolio mix and value composition. Music consumption (popularity) is one of the key measurement points for understanding a song's value.
