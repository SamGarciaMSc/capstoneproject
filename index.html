Hi, my name is Samantha - I'm a finance professional and music valuation specialist.

In 2018, myself and 4 other industry professionals joined forces with a top music manager, a songwriter and Nile Rodgers  - to be the first in the world to list SONGS as an asset class on a stock exchange.

Songs as commodities like oil or gold might sound sad to some, but the business model actually directly and indirectly puts a lot of money into the hands of sognwriters.

Big business opportunity > let me explain > songs are bought in bulk >in this fake example we have a catalogue of 100 songs > WOULD YOU BELIEVE... only around 10-15 of those songs are responsible for 80% of the value or earnings of the whole catalogue.

That means there are 90 under exploited songs! But how do we know which of these songs we should focus our time on to bring easy added value to investors?

We've etablished that SONGS are ASSETS and we're looking for added VALUE.

This is a graph from the Fund's 2021 annual report - taking the $2bn portfolio and representing that by genre.

This is because Investors understand genre and can visualise the VALUE of the portfolio by genre.

HOWEVER - genre is broad, often inaccurate and subjective.

I BELIEVE better decisions can be made to better exploit the songs by grouping them based on FEATURES not genres.

My project - to build a machine learning algorithm to input any song and output VALUE CLUSTERS.

The machine learning algorithm I built can allocate a song into clusters based on the song’s audio features. The next step after this bootcamp is to layer on VALUE – for which I will gain access to private data held by rightsowners.

My algorithm found 4 clusters.

We’ll look at each one.

The most important audio features in my algorithm were:

Valence – best described as how happy or moody a song sounds.

Instrumentalness – how instrumental or conversely vocal a song is.

Danceability – which speaks for itself.

Acousticness – how electric or natural a song  sounds.

Cluster 0: Happy and danceable, more vocal, not as acoustic (i.e. more electric / artificial) –
like contemporary pop music

Cluster 2: Moody, less danceable,
sounds more natural and more instrumental - 
like classical music

Cluster 1: Happy and danceable, less instrumental –
like vocal dance music

Cluster 3: Moody, very instrumental –
like techno/ edm music

As my project develops content will be added here.
