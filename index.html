Welcome to my NFT Capstone Project site!

My project is to build a predictor of best price for NFTs of certain features.

It will determine NFT features that attract best prices and transaction volumes across both overall collection types and individual NFTs within collections.

This tool can be used by NFT creators and new buyers to the NFT marketplace to aid in maximising popularity, price and profit for both buyers and sellers.

Give the people what they don't know they want!

As my project develops content will be added here.

[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  A full list of features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).  

You can edit the `index.html` file to change this content.
